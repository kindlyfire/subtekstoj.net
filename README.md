Esperanto website to get subtitles of series and movies. Made because there doesn't seem to be a good central source of subtitles. Stack should be TypeScript as backend + React as front-end (this is the project I learn React with.)

The website would allow anyone to upload subtitles of movies and series, alongside the creation of "pages" aggregating subtitles for each movie/season of an episode.
